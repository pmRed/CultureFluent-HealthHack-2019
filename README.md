## Introduction


## How to use

### Installation

You can run this project in dev mode by by doing the following  

```sh
gatsby develop
```

Gatsby will start up a web server for you and you are ready to go.

If you've never worked with Gatsby before, I recommend [reading the documentation](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

There is a dockerised version which will build and serve the site. 
### Customizing Semantic UI

To customize Semantic UI you can find the appropriate files in `src/semantic/site`. To understand the file structure provided in that folder, please read the [Customization Guide](http://learnsemantic.com/developing/customizing.html) provided by Semantic UI.

The theme files are pre-filled with all available variables so you can just set them and forget them. As you save those files Gatsby will automatically re-compile your files.
